
    WBAT - Dialog Box Tool        Ver 2.50 (c) 1999-2005 Horst Schaeffer
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    WBAT is a DOS batch utility for dialog boxes with menus, buttons,
    input fields, checkboxes and radio buttons. An INI file is used for
    default colors and preferences. No ANSI stuff to deal with - colors
    are specified by name.

    Although originally made for the GUI DOS box under WIN95, it runs
    nicely in full screen mode or under plain DOS.

    Run DEMO.BAT for more information and complete details (an extra
    DOC file is not supplied).

    If you have already used WBAT, see HISTORY.TXT for news.

    Though WBAT is freeware and does not require registration, I would
    appreciate your feedback. More features will be added - if you are
    interested... So, send me an Email with your bug reports or
    suggestions for future versions.

    WBAT runs under MS-DOS 3.3 or better, or in a DOS box under WINDOWS.

    Note for Win NT/2000/XP users: WBAT may fail to control the color
    palette. Please run NTCOLORS.BAT before Demo.
